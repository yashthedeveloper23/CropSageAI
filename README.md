A simple, responsive, and easy-to-use web application that helps farmers and users predict the best crop to grow based on selected environmental and soil conditions.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Easy to use form-based interface  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user enters the required environmental details:

   - Temperature (°C)
   - Humidity (%)
   - pH level
   - Rainfall (mm)
2. On submitting the form, the app predicts the most suitable crop based on these parameters.
